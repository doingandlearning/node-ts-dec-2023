### Teaching Notes on Generators

---

#### **1. Introduction to Generators:**

- **Definition:** Generators are special types of functions in JavaScript (and hence TypeScript) that allow the function to pause and resume its execution.
- They're indicated by the `function*` syntax.
- Unlike regular functions which run to completion when called, generators yield values one at a time using the `yield` keyword.
- The function execution is paused at each `yield` and can be resumed later.

```typescript
function* generatorFunction() {
  yield "üçë";
  yield "üçâ";
  yield "üçã";
  yield "ü•≠";
}
```

- In the above example, we've defined a simple generator that yields four fruits sequentially.

#### **2. Interacting with Generators:**

- To use a generator, you first need to initialize it. This doesn't execute the function but gives you a generator object.
  
```typescript
const fruitGenerator = generatorFunction();
```

- The generator object has a method called `next()` which when called will execute the generator until the next `yield` statement.
- Each call to `next()` returns an object of the form `{ value: <yielded value>, done: <boolean> }`. The `done` property indicates if the generator has finished execution.

---

#### **3. Infinite Generators:**

- Generators can be designed to run indefinitely, making them very useful for creating sequences that can go on forever, but can be controlled from the outside.

```typescript
function* fibon(): Generator<string> {
  //... code ...
  while (true) {
    //... code ...
    yield `The next value is ${sum}`;
    //... code ...
  }
}
```

- The `fibon` generator will keep producing Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
- This showcases the power of generators: even if a sequence is infinite, we can generate one value at a time on-demand.

#### **4. Practical Application: Fibonacci Sequence**

- The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.
  
```typescript
let first = 1;
let second = 1;
```

- We start off by initializing two variables `first` and `second` to the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

```typescript
while (true) {
    let sum = second + first;
    yield `The next value is ${sum}`;
    first = second;
    second = sum;
}
```

- The generator will loop indefinitely, calculating the next number in the Fibonacci sequence and then yielding it.

---

#### **5. Performance Considerations**

- The final part of the code snippet demonstrates fetching several numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
  
```typescript
console.time();
// multiple sequence.next() calls
console.timeEnd();
```

- Using `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` allows us to measure the time taken for the sequence generation.
- This is an illustrative way to highlight the efficiency of on-demand value generation. Even if the sequence is infinite, we only generate what we need.

---

#### **6. Closing Notes:**

- Generators are powerful because they provide an elegant way to produce and manage sequences, handle asynchronous tasks, etc.
- Their lazy evaluation nature (i.e., only computing values when asked) is a boon for performance especially when dealing with potentially large or infinite data sets.
- When teaching, it's essential to differentiate between regular functions and generators, emphasizing the ability to pause and resume which regular functions can't do.
